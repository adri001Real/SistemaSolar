## Introduction

Educational Solar System Program is an interactive educational software utilizing OpenGL, enabling users to explore our solar system interactively. This project includes detailed information about each planet and offers a visually immersive experience

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed a virtual walkthrough using OpenGL, a powerful graphics API. Users can explore the solar system while learning about each planet's characteristics and other celestial.

### Key Features

- Interactive Exploration: Navigate through the solar system using intuitive controls.
- Educational Content: Detailed information panels provide scientific data about planets and celestial bodies.
- Visual Realism: Accurate 3D models, textures, and shaders enhance realism.
- Performance Optimization: Ensures a smooth and immersive experience.
### Development Highlights

- Virtual Environment Creation:
  - Accurate 3D modeling of planets and celestial bodies.
  - Implementation of textures and shaders for visual realism.
  - Logic development for movement and user interaction.

- Educational Integration:
  - Collection and presentation of scientific data (physical characteristics, atmospheric composition, orbital data).
- Development of interactive information panels for educational purposes.

- Performance Optimization:
  - Techniques applied for smooth graphics rendering.
  - Efficient management of system resources.

### Getting Started

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place freetype.dll in x64>Debug directory.
3. Compile and run main.cpp in the solar system folder.

### How to Use the App

- Planet Selection: Use numeric keys (1-8) to select planets.
  - 1: Mercury
  - 2: Venus
  - 3: Earth
  - 4: Mars
  - 5: Jupiter
  - 6: Saturn
  - 7: Uranus
  - 8: Neptune

- Movements:
  - Zoom in: W key
  - Zoom out: S key
  - Move left: A key
  - Move right: D key
  - Change galaxy background: E key
